The project entitled as 'ACADEMIC AID' is an application for easy tutor selection by students. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly as well provide functionality which is not possible with the manual system. In this project, we are trying to provide teacher an efficient system where s/he can set own profile with personal details and let student themselves decide the tutor through functional chat system. It will cover all the functionality required for the tutor and student management.

In the project, students have the capability to send messages directly to their assigned tutors. It allows students to seek clarification, discuss academic matters privately with their tutors. Students may request a tutor based on their expertise, teaching style, availability, or any other relevant criteria. Students can browse tutors categorized according to the subjects, levels, gender and vicinity they teach. Students can view detailed profiles of tutors, including their qualifications, teaching experience. Teachers can customize their profiles with details like qualifications and experience. Teachers can directly communicate with students for clarity. Teachers can view a list of students assigned to their classes or courses.

Admin can manage information about students and teachers, including personal details, contact information, and academic records. Admin reviews and approves the registration of new teachers, ensuring they meet the qualification and expertise. Admin accesses student requests for specific tutors. Admin can pay salary to the teachers using ESEWA.
